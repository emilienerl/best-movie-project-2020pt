Movie Premise: Taking all six films as a single story, Star Wars tells the story of the 
rise and fall of one of the most powerful Jedis in history, Anakin Skywalker. Anakin's 
talent is disovered, he rises in the ranks of the Jedi, is misled by his own fears, 
corrupted by power, and redeemed by the love of his son.
